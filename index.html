            A Beautiful Lyrics from the Best Song!!
          </h3>

        <p>
          I love it when you call me Señorita I wish I could pretend I didn't
          need ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true la-la-la Ooh, I
          should be running Ooh, you keep me coming For ya <br /> </p>

        <p>  Land in Miami The air was hot from summer rain Sweat dripping off me
          Before I even knew her name la-la-la It felt like ooh-la-la-la Yeah,
          no <br /></p>

          <p>Sapphire moonlight We danced for hours in the sand Tequila Sunrise Her
          body fit right in my hands, la-la-la It felt like ooh-la-la-la Yeah
          <br /></p>

        <p>  I love it when you call me Señorita I wish I could pretend I didn't
          need ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true la-la-la Ooh, I
          should be running Ooh, you know I love it <br /></p>

         <p> When you call me Señorita I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
          But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true la-la-la Ooh, I should be
          running Ooh, you keep me coming For ya <br /></p>

         <p> Locked in the hotel There's just some things that never change You
          say, "We're just friends." But friends don't know the way you
          taste-la-la-la 'Cause you know it's been a long time comin' Don't you
          let me fall, oh <br /></p>

         <p> Ooh, when your lips undress me Hooked on your tongue Ooh, love, your
          kiss is deadly Don't stop <br /></p>

         <p> I love it when you call me Señorita I wish I could pretend I didn't
          need ya But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true la-la-la Ooh, I
          should be running Ooh, you know I love it <br /></p>

        <p>  When you call me Señorita I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
          But every touch is ooh-la-la-la It's true la-la-la Ooh, I should be
          running Ooh, you keep me coming For ya <br /></p>

        <p>  All along I'll be coming for ya (for ya) And I hope it meant something
          to ya Call my name, I'll be comin' for ya (comin' for ya) Comin' for
          ya (comin' for ya) <br /></p>

          <p>For ya, for ya (oh, she loves it when I call her), for ya Ooh, I
          should be running Ooh, you keep me coming For ya </p>
